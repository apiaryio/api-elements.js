# API Elements: OpenAPI 2 Parser Changelog

## 0.32.5 (2020-02-24)

### Enhancements

- `additionalProperties` found within 'Schema Object' will now be translated
  into the parse result's data structure section.

## 0.32.4 (2020-10-13)

### Bug Fixes

- The HOST URI metadata produced from `schemes`, `host` and `basePath` will now
  default to `https` when `schemes` is not defined. Previously a partial URI
  without a scheme was returned.

## 0.32.3 (2020-08-06)

Adds compatibility for @apielements/core 0.2.0.

## 0.32.2 (2020-07-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Improvements to generation of JSON message bodies to add more cases where
  `example` property of a Schema Object will be respected.  
  [#515](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/pull/515)

## 0.32.1 (2020-06-22)

### Enhancements

- Performance improvements to OpenAPI 2 validation, this will only apply to
  validation only. Full OpenAPI 2 parsing is not altered.

### Bug Fixes

- Returns a validation error while trying to parse a YAML or JSON object which
  does not contain the `swagger` key, in prior versions the parser may have
  crashed under some inputs.

- Improved clarity of validation error messages.

- Fixes a case where the source map information may be missing for one type of
  validation errors.

## 0.32.0 (2020-06-12)

The package has been updated for compatibility with `@apielements/core`.

## 0.31.1 (2020-06-09)

### Bug Fixes

- This release includes performance improvements to parsing documents which
  contain the same schema re-used via a reference (`$ref`) many times in
  request parameters and response bodies under an `allOf` key.

## 0.31.0 (2020-05-12)

### Bug Fixes

- The parser will now produce a data structure for Schema Object's which do not
  contain a `type`.

- Added the `fixedType` attribute to array data structures which describe
  arrays with fixed types in the items. For example, the following schema which
  describes an array where the values MUST be of type string:

  ```yaml
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
  ```

  Previously we generated a data structure for an array which didn't fix the
  values of the array to be a string type. Instead provided an example that the
  value of the array MAY be a string.

- Support required keys in a Schema Object which are not found in the
  properties list.

## 0.30.0 (2020-04-29)

The package has been renamed to `@apielements/openapi2-parser`.

## 0.29.0 (2020-04-20)

### Enhancements

- Compatibility with [Fury 3.0.0 Beta 14](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/releases/tag/fury@3.0.0-beta.14).

- The parser can now be configured to disable generation of example message
  bodies and message body schemas by providing an adapter option
  `generateMessageBody` or `generateMessageBodySchema` as `false` during parse.

## 0.28.3 (2020-03-16)

### Enhancements

- Adds support for `info.termsOfService`.
  For example the following document:

  ```yaml
  swagger: '2.0'
  info:
    termsOfService: http://example.com/terms/
  ```

  will add the link to the terms of service `http://example.com/terms/`

- Adds support for `info.contact`.
  For example the following document:

  ```yaml
  swagger: '2.0'
  info:
    url: http://www.example.com/support
    email: support@example.com
  ```

  will add a link to the contact URL and a second link to the contact email

## 0.28.2 (2020-02-07)

### Bug Fixes

- This release includes performance improvements to parsing documents which
  contain the same schema re-used via a reference (`$ref`) many times in
  request parameters and response bodies.

## 0.28.1 (2020-01-30)

### Bug Fixes

- Sets an explicit `$schema` property on JSON Schema generated from a Swagger
  document in `convertSchema`. Sets a JSON Schema Draft V4 as the value of the
  `$schema` property, making generated schema implement a JSON Schema Draft V4.

## 0.28.0 (2019-12-06)

### Enhancements

- Compatibility with [Fury 3.0.0 Beta 13](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/releases/tag/fury@3.0.0-beta.13).

## 0.27.2 (2019-08-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Prevents a 'Path Item Object' from being included in a Resource Group created
  by an 'Operation Object' in a previously defined 'Path Item Object'.

- Optional parameters will now include an optional typeAttribute in the parse
  result. This will fix conversion to API Blueprint with fury-cli where
  optional parameters have shown up as required in the generated API Blueprint.

- Allows generating of JSON bodies for schemas which make use of `allOf` and
  include circular references. Under some circumstances this would previously
  fail, and a warning may have been emitted "Unable to generate
  application/json example message body out of JSON Schema"

## 0.27.1 (2019-06-03)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a problem while parsing a document which contains a Swagger Schema for
  a string which contains both a `minLength` and a `pattern` property which are
  incompatible. For example, the following pattern: `^[A-z]*$` which is making
  use of `*` which means that it allows strings that are zero length or more.
  If there is a property `minLength` which is incompatible with the pattern
  such as if `minLength` is set to 1. Previously this would cause the parser to
  get into an infinite loop.

## 0.26.0 (2019-06-11)

### Breaking

- Support for NodeJS 6 has been removed, upgrading to NodeJS 8 or newer is
  recommended.

### Bug Fixes

- JSON value generation will now support schemas which contain an array of objects.
  For example, the following schema:

  ```yaml
  type: array
  items:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        example: doe
  ```

  Will now emit a JSON value of `[{ "name": "doe" }]`, whereas before it would
  emit an empty array `[]`.

  [#236](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/issues/236)

- While parsing an 'Example Object' (found in a 'Schema Object') which contains
  an object with a property `length` anywhere in the example tree. The example
  object will be interpreted as an array of the given length. If the value of
  `length` property of an 'Example Object' is a large number, then the parser
  may utilise a lot of memory while producing a result and subsequently may
  cause out of memory failures.

  For example:

  ```yaml
  definitions:
    User:
      type: object
      example:
        length: 50000
  ```

## 0.25.1 (2019-04-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a potential parser crash while handling an example value for a 'Schema
  Object' which contains an invalid reference.

## 0.25.0 (2019-03-26)

### Enhancements

- Compatibility with [Fury 3.0.0 Beta 10](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/releases/tag/fury@3.0.0-beta.10).

## 0.24.2 (2019-03-15)

### Bug Fixes

- Support JSON Body generation when a schema contains an unknown "format".
  Previously this would cause a warning:

  > Unable to generate application/json example message body out of JSON Schema

## 0.24.1 (2019-03-05)

### Bug Fixes

- Supports data structure generation for references for a value inside another
  definition. For example a reference to `#/definitions/User/properties/name`.

- Removes duplicate description values placed on members for data structure
  properties.

## 0.24.0 (2019-02-26)

### Enhancements

- Compatibility with [Fury 3.0.0 Beta 9](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/releases/tag/fury-3.0.0-beta.9).

### Bug Fixes

- Removed uses of `process.nextTick` which could cause any exceptions raised by
  the Fury adapter to be uncaught exceptions in Node JS.
  https://github.com/apiaryio/fury-adapter-swagger/issues/169

## 0.23.2 (2019-01-25)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix cases where example values in schema definitions are not used in request
  or response bodies.

## 0.23.1 (2019-01-10)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a case where having `null` as an enum value or having
  `x-nullable: true` on a schema with `enum` will cause an obscure error:

  > Cannot read property '$ref' of null

## 0.23.0 (2018-12-21)

### Breaking

- Swagger Parser now requires [Fury 3.0.0 Beta 8](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-elements.js/releases/tag/fury-3.0.0-beta.8).

## 0.22.7 (2018-12-11)

### Bug Fixes

- Adds support for generating JSON bodies for schemas where the root is an
  array. For example, given following array schema:

  ```yaml
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
    example: Doe
  ```

  The parser will now generate a JSON body of `["Doe"]` whereas in previous
  versions would've resulted in an empty array.

- Fixes parsing Swagger documents that contain properties called `$ref`.
  Previously the parser would attempt to dereference the property as would
  generically try to dereference any key in an object called `$ref`, as per the
  JSON Schema specification, references are only permitted when a schema type
  is expected.

  For example, the following is a schema which is trying to describe an object
  with a property called `$ref`, previously the parser would attempt to
  dereference `$ref` and crash in the process.

  ```yaml
  type: object
  properties:
    $ref:
      type: string
      example: '#/definitions/User'
  required: ['$ref']
  ```

  There is a still an open known issue
  [#235](https://github.com/apiaryio/fury-adapter-swagger/issues/235) that
  uses of `$ref` in a Swagger 2 document where the value a string will cause
  the parser to attempt to dereference it incorrectly when the `$ref` property
  is found on an object that does not support `$ref` as per the Swagger 2 and
  JSON Schema specifications.

## 0.22.6 (2018-12-07)

### Enhancements

- While generating a data structure from a Swagger Schema, we will now attempt
  to infer when the schema should be an object but the user has forgotten to
  put `type: object` by looking for the presence of `properties` in the schema.

- Adds support for object inheritance and mixins via `allOf` referencing in
  data structure generation.

  For example, the following will create an object which inherits from `User`:

  ```yaml
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/definitions/User'
    - properties:
        id:
          type: string
  ```

  Secondly, when you reference multiple objects using `allOf` they will be
  treated as mixins:

  ```yaml
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/definitions/BaseUser'
    - $ref: '#/definitions/UserMixin'
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes using `x-nullable` in a schema which previously caused the schema not
  to be converted to a data structure. For example, the following schema
  wouldn't result in a data structure:

  ```yaml
  type: string
  x-nullable: true
  ```

- Fixes some cases where rendering a JSON example from a Swagger Schema using
  example values which contain references would fail.

## 0.22.4 (2018-11-29)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a regression introduced in 0.22.3 which caused a reference (`$ref`)
  from a definition to another definitions example value to fail.

## 0.22.3 (2018-11-27)

### Bug Fixes

- Example values in nested Schema Object will now be used for JSON body
  generation.

## 0.22.2 (2018-10-25)

- Fixes a regression introduced in 0.22.0 where using `$ref` directly inside a
  Swagger Schema found within the `definitions` section would cause a parsing
  failure.

## 0.22.1 (2018-10-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a regression introduced in 0.22.0 where the parse result may contain
  invalid references inside a JSON Schema for example values if they used
  references. This regression also caused `$ref` to be incorrectly present in
  Data Structure sample values.

## 0.22.0 (2018-10-11)

### Enhancements

- Adds a dataStructures section to the parse result containing every data
  structure found within the definitions section of a Swagger document. We now
  use referencing between data structures found within a request or response
  data structure which generally makes parse results smaller instead of
  duplicating the data structure contents.

### Bug Fixes

- Adds support for primitive request bodies.

## 0.21.1 (2018-09-10)

### Bug Fixes

- No longer expand all option values (properties, array values) etc in the case
  that a schema has a circular reference.

## 0.21.0 (2018-09-07)

### Enhancements

- Line and column numbers are now exposed in the parse result in source maps
  for annotation elements.

### Bug Fixes

- Default and example values for headers are now validated to match the header
  type. For example, placing a string as a value for a number type header will
  now emit a warning.

- Header values will now contain source map information in the parse result.

- Fix support for type `file` in multipart-form body generation.

## 0.20.0 (2018-09-04)

### Enhancements

- The API Version is now exposed in the parse result. The API category now
  contains a version attribute including the API version.

- Circular references are now supported in schemas and JSON and JSON Schemas
  will now be present in parse results when you use circular references.

### Bug Fixes

- Example values in a Schema Object will now be placed into the dataStructure
  as a value instead of inside samples in cases where there isn't already a
  value.

## 0.19.2

### Bug Fixes

- Return an error in the parse result when the source API Description Document
  is not an object. Previously an error was thrown.

- When a request or response body has a schema of `format: binary` then we no
  longer generate a JSON Schema in the parse result. A JSON Schema for binary
  types doesn't make sense as you cannot place binary data in JSON.

- Example values found in schemas are now translated into examples in
  generated JSON Schema exposed in parse results.

- Data Structure sample values will now include schema example values.

- Request and Response body examples will now respect the example values of a
  schema.

## 0.19.1

### Enhancements

- When a schema uses `allOf` and doesn't provide a type hint at the schema
  root, the `allOf` types are matched for object schemas. This allows the
  following schema to work where before `type: object` was required at the
  schema root at the same level as `allOf`:

  ```yaml
  allOf:
    - type: object
      properties:
        username:
          type: string
    - type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- When using `enum` in conjunction with `x-nullable` in a schema, this will now
  result in the `null` value being present in schema if it isn't already.

## 0.19.0

### Enhancements

- Enumeration behaviour is now the same as API Elements 1.0 such that the
  values that are fixed will now have a fixed type attribute.

## 0.18.4

### Enhancements

- Swagger `security-scheme` vendored extensions are now present in the parse
  result.

### Bug Fixes

- Supports detecting Swagger documents which are JSON formatted with spaces
  before the `:`. For example, the following document would not be matched to
  this adapter: `{ "swagger" : "2.0" }`.

- When a parameter has no valid enumerations defined in an `enum`, we will now
  discard the enumeration in the parse result. Previously the parser would create an
  empty enumeration element from completely invalid enumerations in a Swagger
  document which can cause issues further down in subsequent tooling and Minim
  serialisation.

## 0.18.3

### Bug Fixes

- Swagger Schemas are now recursively translated from Swagger schema into JSON
  Schema draft 4 in the resultant messageSchema of a parse result. This fixes
  bugs where components such as `x-nullable`, `readOnly`, `externalDocs` etc
  are not handled when found inside another schema as a sub-schema.

## 0.18.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where auth scheme elements are re-used multiple times in
  a parse result which can cause exceptions when the parse result is frozen.
  This is in the case where you have multiple consumes so multiple
  request/response pairs are created for the action.

## 0.18.1

### Enhancements

- Allow `date` and `date-time` format support.

## 0.18.0

### Breaking

- Support for Node 4 was removed. Node 6 is the minimum supported version of
  Node.

### Enhancements

- Adds support for the `x-nullable` schema extension. This allows adding `null`
  as a type to a schema. This is an OpenAPI 3 feature ported to Swagger 2 as a
  vendored extension.  
  [#112](https://github.com/apiaryio/fury-adapter-swagger/issues/112)

## 0.17.0

### Enhancements

- Optional object properties are now always present in generated JSON examples.

## 0.16.1

### Bug Fixes

- Allow parsing Swagger parameters of array type which do not have samples and
  offer `items` which does not include a type.
- Coerce a resource `x-summary` value to a string if it is not already a
  string. When a user enters an incorrect type such as boolean, number or
  array. The title would become an incorrect type and can cause subsequent
  tooling to fail.

## 0.16.0

### Enhancements

- Samples and Defaults of enum schema and parameters are now wrapped
  in enum element.

## 0.15.2

### Enhancements

- File type parameters are now included instead of being ignored.

## 0.15.1

### Bug Fixes

- Data Structure generation was not including required typeAttribute for
  required object properties.

## 0.15.0

### Enhancements

- Sample values are now generated for data structures of object and array types.
- Request/Response pairs are now generated from explicit examples, or the first
  JSON produces content-type.

## 0.14.3

### Bug Fixes

- Generated multipart form-data example requests were missing the end of the
  multi-part.
- `example` properties in Schema Object are not respected in data structure
  generation.


## 0.14.2

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent throwing or attaching additional warning while handling a source YAML
  document that produces an error while using the `generateSourceMap` flag.

  There was a race condition where the `done` callback can be called twice as
  we would call the callback with an error and `fury` would catch a raised
  error and then return that error. This would also cause a state when parsing
  an invalid YAML document would produce an error AND a warning in the returned
  parse result.

## 0.14.1

### Enhancements

- Request example bodies are now generated for formData parameters while using
  the `multipart/form-data` consumes content type.

## 0.14.0

### Bug Fixes

- Request and response pairs are now created for all combinations of produces,
  and consumes content types. This includes multiple JSON content types which
  we're previously discarded and non-JSON content types.
- `multipart/form-data` consumes type is no longer replaced by
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` when formData parameters are provided.
  [#96](https://github.com/apiaryio/fury-adapter-swagger/issues/96)

## 0.13.4

### Enhancements

- Added support for `externalDocs`.
- Parser will now give warning about unsupported collection formats in parameters.

## 0.13.3

### Bug Fixes

- Parameter default, example and enumerations values are now validated against
  the parameter type. Invalid values will emit warnings and be discarded, this
  resolves further problems when handling the invalid values.
- Data Structure generation will now support integer JSON Schema type.

## 0.13.2

### Bug Fixes

- HOST metadata was incorrectly included in an attribute called `meta`. The
  attribute was renamed to `metadata` in API Elements 1.0.
- Fixes an issue where auth scheme elements are re-used multiple times in
  a parse result which can cause exceptions when the parse result is frozen.

## 0.13.1

### Bug Fixes

- Handle array parameters which contain enumerations.

## 0.13.0

- Compatibility with [Minim 0.19](https://github.com/refractproject/minim/releases/tag/v0.19.0)
  and [Fury 3.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/apiaryio/fury.js/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.4).

- Updates to fury 3.0.0-beta.2.

### Bug Fixes

- Adds support for `csv` and `multi` parameter collectionFormat for query
  parameters.

- Parameters which define both an example (`x-example`) and `items` schema will
  now use the `x-example` value as the example.

- URI Template variables are now correctly escaped.

## 0.12.0-beta.2

### Bug Fixes

- Data Structure generation from JSON Schema handles array items which
  contain empty values.

## 0.12.0-beta.1

### Enhancements

- Data Structure elements are now generated from JSON Schema found in examples.

## 0.11.1 (2017-04-25)

### Bug Fixes

## 0.9.8 (2016-10-31)

### Bug Fixes

- Prevents constructing large arrays and strings when generating a request or
  response body from a JSON Schema where there is a large
  `minItems`, `maxItems`, `minLength` or `maxLength`.

## 0.9.7 (2016-10-25)

### Bug Fixes

- Prevents dereferencing external assets such as local files.

## 0.9.5 (2016-09-01)

### Bug Fixes

- Improves error reporting in some cases when references are involved.

- Improves error reporting when the YAML document contains YAML syntax errors
  to include source maps and the YAML error.

## 0.9.4 (2016-08-30)

## 0.9.3 (2016-08-30)

### Bug Fixes

- Added support to exclude extensions from operations

## 0.9.2 (2016-08-26)

### Enhancements

- Upgraded lodash dependency from 3.x.x to 4.x.x

### Enhancements

- Added support for adding example values to parameters using `x-example`

## 0.9.0 (2016-07-27)

### Enhancements

- Added support for parameter property called x-example, which allows to specify
  example values also for non-body parameters.

## 0.8.1 (2016-07-16)

### Enhancements

- The adapter is more asynchronous and thus, gives other events in the event
  loop the ability to run while we're parsing the Swagger document.

## 0.8.0 (2016-07-01)

### Enhancements

- Added authentication support.
- Swagger vendor extensions are now exposes as API Element extensions.
- Response and Request bodies are generated from Schema whenever applicable.
- Accept and Content-type headers are generated based on produces and consumes keys whenever applicable.
- Sample values for non-body parameters are generated whenever applicable.
- Header parameters are appended to request/response header collection.
- Added `formData` support and appropirate request body generation.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed metadata not being an array of Member Elements.
- Added source maps to resource.href, httpRequest.method, httpResponse.statusCode.
- Removed several unneeded source maps.
- Circular schema references will now give a warning about not being supported yet.
- Added fragment to uncaught error.
- Fixed bug with parameters sourcemaps when they are mixture of body and query parameters.

## 0.7.3 (2016-04-12)

- All exceptions thrown when converting swagger to refract will now be caught and returned as a proper error in parse result

## 0.7.2 (2016-02-18)

- Add an example for testing the module in the browser via TonicDev.

## 0.7.1 (2016-02-15)

- Swagger's `operationId` is now correctly interpreted as transition element's `id` instead of `relation`.

## 0.7.0 (2016-02-02)

- Swagger documents that do not validate against the JSON Schema for Swagger
  will no longer be translated into Refract and instead expose errors for the
  validation failures.

## 0.6.2 (2016-01-13)

- Bad JSON references (using `$ref`) are now returned as parse result
  annotations that include source maps which point to the `$ref` line, making
  debugging easier.

## 0.6.1 (2016-01-11)

- Fix handling of resource `href`, which could get overwritten while processing transitions and result in missing parameters in the URI template.
- Code refactoring

  - Parsing is now handled by a class to more easily share state between various methods. This lays the framework for more refactoring and code cleanup.
  - The parser shared state tracks the path of the component currently being parsed, which makes it easier to split pieces of the parser into separate methods.
  - YAML AST lookup paths are now arrays of strings rather than strings of period-separated components, which made escaping very difficult.
  - Rather than guessing the YAML type, the AST lookup now checks and handles it accordingly. Paths like `'foo.bar.0.baz'` would fail previously and now work (but are passed as `['foo', 'bar', '0', 'baz']`).
  - Underscore is now replaced with Lodash for consistency with other modules.

## 0.6.0 (2015-12-14)

  - Invalid YAML now returns error

## 0.5.3 (2015-12-11)

- Add source maps for YAML parse error annotations, which were previously missing.

## 0.5.2 (2015-12-10)

- Add support for `formData` parameters, which get converted into request data structures.
- Add source maps for `messageBodySchema` assets.

## 0.5.1 (2015-12-10)

- Do not encode JSON strings twice
- Support `x-summary` and `x-description` in Path Item Objects
